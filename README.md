[![Run on Replit.com](https://replit.com/badge/github/hieyou1/twitch-streamsaver)](https://replit.com/github/hieyou1/twitch-streamsaver)

We don't have licenses for the emotes, so just imagine a great screenshot of the website working right here, or use the link.

## Usage
You can [view/use this live on my website via Replit](https://streamsaver.mikeylab.com), but for big or important streams or streamers I'd recommend hosting manually [using the instructions in the wiki](https://github.com/hieyou1/twitch-streamsaver/wiki/Set-up-your-own-instance-of-Twitch-Streamsaver) because of some instability with Replit.
